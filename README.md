If anyone is reading this, README is incomplete rn but if you want to immediately test the project, you can fill the following typeform and the agent will initialize:

However please note that for on 15th June it may not work as I was heavily testing the project and used up the free trial credits, if you would like, test it tomorrow. Testing today will probably just lead it to not working at all.

Testing locally is tedious and too much work to set up but I will update soon with a guide for local testing
